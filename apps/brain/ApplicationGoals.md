Input gets messaged to Thalamus.  
 - Sensor to Thalamus.  Map sensor to processes in the Thalamus

Thalamus checks for previous input.
Thalamus subtracts previous input from current input.
Thalamus projects input to layer 4 of region
Layer 4 forwards input to layer 2/3.
Layer 2/3 outputs the rest of the region.
Layer 5 gets activated by layer 2/3 and layer 2/3 projections.
Layer 5 also gets activated by layer 1.
Layer 6 gets input from layer 2/3
Layer 6 projects to TRN as previous input.
Layer 5 projects to senses and to Thalamus matrix.
Matrix projects to similar regions of cortex as previous input to layer 1.
Repeat.
