### Overview

**Layer I**
  > This layer is called the molecular layer. As you can see from the diagram, it has very few neurons and cells. Instead, it is mainly composed of dendrites and axons that extend from lower levels of the neocortex.  Contains many synapses though no cell bodies.

**Layer II**
  > Because this is one of the outer layers, and it is composed of granule cells, scientists named it the external granule layer.  Contains small pyramidal and stellate cells.

 > **Function**: Receives inputs from other areas of the neocortex.

**Layer III**
  > This is the external pyramidal cell layer. Pyramidal cells make up this layer; they are called "pyramidal" because their somas are triangular shaped. Pyramidal cells are moderate in size and get bigger deeper into the cortex. Also contains Martinotti cells.

  > **Function**: Receives input from other cortical regions and outputs to other cortical columns.

**Layer IV**
  > Located deeper within the neocortex, and composed of granule cells, this layer is thus called the internal granule layer.  Composed mainly of densely packed stellate cells.

  > **Function**: Granule cells in this layer receive sensory input and relay it to adjacent neocortex columns. Layer IV is very thick in primary sensory cortex (i.e. the primary visual cortex).

**Layer V**
  > Another layer of pyramidal cells makes up the neocortex. The cells in this internal pyramidal cell layer are larger than those in Layer III.  Contains the largest pyramidal cells, a few stellate cells, Martinotti cells, and Betz pyramidal cells.

  > **Function**: Layer V is involved heavily in making motor movements.

**Layer VI**
  > Many different types of cells make up this layer. Its structure isn't very homogenous, so it was called the multiform layer.  Fusiform cells are found deeper into the layer and other cells are found higher.

  > **Function**: Receiving and integrating information from the brainstem and outputs to the thalamus.

### Terms
- **Afferent Fibers**: Input from senses.
- **Efferent Fibers**: Output to senses.
- **Pyramidal cells**: Pyramid shaped with a long dendrite branch at the top and a long axon extending from the opposite side of the cell body. Are the primary output of column due to the long length of its axon. The dendrite forms spines along some of the branches and these are considered to be the connections between the synapse to learn a new connection.
- **fusiform cells**: Spindle shaped and oriented perpendicular to the cortex.  Axon arises from the side and passes to other higher layers.  Dendrites extend into layers from all sides of the cell.  Functions like a *pyramidal cell*.
- **Stellate cells(Granular)**: are the principal interneurons of the cortex because the axon is short and does not leave the cortex
- **Horizontal Cell of Cajal**: Spindle shaped, oriented parallel to surface and only found in highest layer.  Axons pass laterally to synapse with dendrites of *pyramidal cells*.  Disappear after birth.
- **Cells of Martinotti**: have short dendrites and an axon that reaches for the cortex surface and bifurcates to run horizontally in most superficial layers.  Forms synapses with pyramidal cells.
- **Betz Cells**: Pyramidal cells that are very large.  Exist in layer 5 and have a primary dendrite that extends all the way to layer 1. Plays a role in motor cortex.
- **granule cells**: a number of different types of neuron whose only common feature is that they all have very small cell bodies
- **supragranular layers**: (Layers 1-3) - project out to other cortical columns, both sending and receiving signals, with layer III cells projecting to adjacent columns and layer II cells projecting to more distant parts of the cortex.
- **infragranular layers**: (Layers 5-6) - receive input from the supragranular cells of adjacent columns, although they do not reciprocate; instead, they send their signals to extracortical structures, such as the thalamus, and motor and sensory centers.
- **supragranular/infragranular process**:
  > Layer IV, which divides the column into supragranular and infragranular parts, receives its inputs from the thalamus and transmits signals to the rest of the column. The thalamus receives information from all parts of the cortex and subcortical areas. It works together with the cerebral cortex to create a feedback circuit by passing information from the infragranular cells of the cortex to the thalamus and then back to the layer IV cells of the cortex, with integration occurring both on in the thalamic and cortical centers.  Information flow in the cortex is mediated by the action of the supragranular cells, while additional information from the external and internal environment is integrated by the thalamus and arrives in layer IV of the cortical columns.
